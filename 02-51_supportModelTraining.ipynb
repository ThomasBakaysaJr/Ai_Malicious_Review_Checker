      "5045\t0\t2014-09-08\tThis was the worst experience I've ever had a casual coffee/light fare place.  The server disappeared for 20 minutes, just talking to his friend by the window as my girlfriend and I sat dumbfounded that this dude had the nerve to do that on the job.  We're trying to make eye contact, but clearly getting paid to talk to his bud was more important to him. My girlfriend went up to the counter once the server disappeared into the back for another 5 minutes (what is this guy doing?) and asked if she should order food up there or something.  The girl at the counter gives her a weird look and just says \"I'll get your server.\"  When they arrive from the back, they look over at our table and have a laugh.  Yeah, leaving us hanging for half-a-goddamn hour at a place with only two other customers is not funny - but in retrospect, your collective incompetence and false sense of entitlement certainly was. The food was okay.  For a place called \"toast,\" I'd figured the bread would be better, but it was just cold Le Bus.  Additionally, I'm 95% sure the \"andouille\" in my special was just a link of the pre-packaged offering from Trader Joe's cut into four pieces.  $9 for unapologetic mediocrity will not be happening again. Avoid this place like the plague.  I almost didn't leave a tip, and honestly I shouldn't have.  I felt the buyer's remorse all day.  What a disgrace.\n",

      "5047\t0\t2014-11-30\tI enjoyed coffee and breakfast twice at Toast during my recent visit to Philly. The first morning I enjoyed the Omelette du Jour which had a savory filling of roast tomato, portobello, artichoke, goat cheese, and wilted spinach. It was accompanied by a crisp small side salad of baby greens, tomato, and berries. The house dressing was light and complementary, not at all over powering. I just HAD to complement the chef. The barista recommended a pour over coffee and it did not disappoint. He prepared my cup with care and attention to time and form. I followed the pour over with a wonderful latte, again prepared very well. As I was leaving town, I decided to visit again for breakfast before my long trip ahead. This breakfast was a delicious Eggs Benedict combo that was perfectly done and complemented by mushrooms, roast tomato, and a generous helping of wilted greens. A rich cup of melted butter accompanied the dish and the sweet side salad again brought balance to my meal. This time the barista made me a perfect cup of French Pressed Guatemalan Vienna roast coffee. It was balanced and bright, yet rich in flavor. I had to have a second cup to go! Cudos to the barista, chef, and friendly staff. Toast is definitely a place to visit, eat, and enjoy coffee prepared in a variety ways. Don't miss this one!\n",

I'm a fan of the large windows - it's the perfect location to sit and people watch for a little while. Nestled in Center City, Toast provides people like me who travel into the city for work a little haven to de-stress and kick back a little bit. The staff is wonderfully friendly and always eager to provide their own suggestions when you're not sure what to get.  Now that school is starting back up it also makes it the perfect environment to settle down and do some studying. I love the fact that they play Maps by the Yeah Yeah Yeah's - and related Pandora stations - it really sets the mood to unwind or have casual conversation with some friends. Can't wait to go back!\n",

      "5052\t0\t2014-11-26\tI really wanted to love toast. It's quaint and cozy, and it was a perfect place to hop on a call while on my layover in Philadelphia. I figured I'd get a latte and some food while there. The latte was upwards of $4 for a small. I also ordered a turkey sausage grilled cheese, which I believe was around $10. We sat down and availed ourselves to the free wifi (great perk) while waiting for our food, which came within 15 mins. I took a bite of my crunchy grilled cheese, which was basically the size of a wonder bread slice, and was immediately horrified. This is not a grilled cheese with turkey sausage; this is a fucking abomination. I spread the sandwich and there was ONE slice of cheese on it--it was so dry that it wasn't even gooey or sticky. Also, there was ONE turkey sausage link that was sliced in half and spread diagonally across the sandwich. I would say that approximately 70% of the sandwich was turkey-less. The server happened to be nearby so my boyfriend said something about how the grilled cheese had no cheese...and he happily took it back and made a new one, with more cheese and the same amount of turkey sausage. It was a nice gesture but honestly, it's highway robbery to serve that sandwich and charge $10 for it. At the very most that sandwich costs $2 to make...and I'm including the side of salad greens. Overall, toast needs to step up their game. A little less stingy with the cheese, Some small tweaks to the menu, and slightly more reasonable prices, and the place would be great.\n",

My friends and I initially planned on Green Eggs Café, but because we would have had to wait 45 minutes for a table, we came here instead. Not only did the waitress seat us quickly, but the place also provided a very toasty ambience. (No pun intended.) I ordered a plate of their special egg toast: two poached eggs served atop a homemade split English muffin, with smoked salmon and asaparagus on the side. (I opted out of the Hollandaise sauce.) O-M-G. While I didn't get that runny yolk porn experience, each bite was a delicious sensation of salty and savory. Also, that English muffin was on point - so chewy and carb-y. I definitely recommend this place for a nice brunch minus the the terribly long line.\n",
